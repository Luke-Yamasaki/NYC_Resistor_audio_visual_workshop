## Workshop overview
A lot of people from different backgrounds gathered today at NYC Resistor to explore the possibilities of live coding as it relates to audio and visual arts. 

Many of us are professional coders, but we also have those who have never coded before, which is really inspiring to see.

## Workshop schedule
This was a three hour workshop exploring how to create music with code, using a web-based tool called [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/), a browser version of [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/).

- Yourself
- A laptop (w/ google chrome)
